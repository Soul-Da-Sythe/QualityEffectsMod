*Drugs are hard.*  

---

This is a quick mod that makes the **Athletic** and **Anti-Gravity** effects scale based on the quality of the drug.

- **Poor quality** drugs give **half** the effect strength of Standard.
- **Legendary quality** (Heavenly) drugs give **50% more**.  


UPDATE
Now affects Energizing, and Energizing now stacks with Athletic!
